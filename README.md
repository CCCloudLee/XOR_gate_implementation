# XOR_gate_implementation
Implement XOR gate using NAND gates only.
1. Only use GATE LEVEL, that is, do not use assign and always, only use logic gates to construct circuits.
2. How to use NAND gate : 
    
          nand (c, a, b );   // c is the output, a and b are inputs.
                             // a, b, c are not port name, they are identifiers designed by you.
